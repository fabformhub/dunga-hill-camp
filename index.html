  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      Although commonly referred to as a “camp,” Dunga Hill Camp does not function as a
      formal campsite or regulated tourism facility. In practice, it operates as an
      informal bar, grill, and social gathering space that attracts a wide cross-section
      of Kisumu residents and visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The venue is particularly active during late afternoons and evenings, especially
      on weekends and public holidays. Experiences at Dunga Hill Camp vary considerably
      depending on crowd size, weather conditions, staffing, and demand.
    </p>

  <!-- NATURE OF THE VENUE -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Nature and Function</h2>

    <p>
      Dunga Hill Camp should be understood as an informal, open-air hospitality venue.
      Operations are not governed by fixed service standards typical of hotels, resorts,
      or licensed campsites. Seating is predominantly outdoors and environmental factors
      such as lake winds, rainfall, dust, and noise directly affect comfort levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elevated lakeside position contributes to its popularity as a sunset-viewing
      location, but also exposes patrons to changing weather and fluctuating operating
      conditions.
